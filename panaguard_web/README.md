Panaguard's web app (for dispatchers), server, and APIs.

  * **/client/index.js** - The React.js web app through which dispatchers are paired with emergencies.
  * **/models** - Data models for emergency contacts, emergencies, users' medical information, and dispatchers (whose data model file is misleadingly named user.js)
  * **/routes/auth.js** - Routes for dispatcher registration and login.
  * **app.js** - The Node.js server, which also runs the WebSocket server connecting users with dispatchers.
